# Sign up Azure Subscription

Creating an Azure free account is one way to access Azure services. When you start using Azure with a free account, you get $200 credit to spend in the first 30-day after you sign up. In addition, you get free monthly amounts of two groups of services: Popular services, which are free for 12 months, and 25+ other services that are free always. Free services are based on resource and region availability.

If you are a student, you may select Azure Student account, which has slightly different offering.

## Azure Services Pricing Model

Each Azure service has different pricing model.  Many of them includes **Free** SKU.  For example, Azure IoT Hub has F1 SKU which is free of charge.

## Azure Free Account vs. Azure for Students

Both Azure Free Account and Azure for Students provides :

- Subscription for 1 year
- Azure Credit
- Access to more than 25 Azure services, both free SKUs and non-free SKUs

Difference are followings:

| Subscription Type  | Azure Credit and spending limits                           | Note                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure Free Account | $200, must be used within 30 days after account sign up.   | Within 30 days of sign-up or upon exhaustion of the Credits (whichever occurs first), you must upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription by removing the Spending Limit. |
| Azure for Students | #100, must be used within 12 months after account sign up. | Additional benefits such as software download benefits for education, non-commercial purpose.                                                                          |

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure you sign up for Azure Free Account or Azure for Students when you are ready.  Your 30 day spending limit timer will start when you sign up.

If you are a student, you can sign up for Azure for Students and enjoy $100 credit for a year.

If you are not a student, you can sign up for Azure Free Account.  Enjoy $200 credit for 30 days.  After 30 days, please upgrade to Pay-as-you-go subscription to continue to use the subscription.  By upgrading to pay-as-you-go subscription, you can continue to use Azure services, including Free SKUs.  If you choose to use non-free SKU, you will be charged based on pricing model of each service you choose to use.
