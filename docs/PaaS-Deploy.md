# Deploy PaaS IoT Solution

This sample solution is built with 6 Azure IoT Platform services.

- Azure [IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub/) : To establish secure bi-directional communication with DE10-Nano.
- Azure IoT Hub [Device Provisioning Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/about-iot-dps) : To provision DE10-Nano to IoT solution.
- Azure [App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/) : To host Web site.
- Azure [Storage Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/) : Storage space used for the web application.
- Azure [Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/) : To process device data and push to Web application.
- Azure [SignalR](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/signalr-service/) : To feed real-time data to the web application.
- [IoT Plug and Play](https://aka.ms/iotpnp) enabled

Click [here](PaaS-DeepDive.md) to learn more in details.

With this sample solution, you can perform basic IoT operations:

- Basic Device Management  
  - Provision a device
  - Connects a device to Azure IoT
  - Manage device identity
- Visualize telemetry (messages) from the device in Web UI
- Visualize device events such as device connect and disconnect in Web UI  

## 1. Start deploying Azure IoT Services

Click **Deploy to Azure** button below.  The button will take you to Azure Portal and loads [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview).  

> [!TIP]  
> <https://portal.azure.com> is called **Azure Portal** which is a web-based, unified GUI tool where you can monitor and manage Azure services.
>
> ARM template is saved in **[deploy](../deploy/azuredeploy.json)** folder.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fterasic%2FInnovateFPGA2021%2Fmain%2Fdeploy%2Fazuredeploy.json)

> [!TIP]  
> Right click the button below and select **Open link in new tab** or **Open link in new window**

## 2. Basic settings for your solution

Each deployment requires unique settings and parameters.  Please provide information to personalize your deployment.
