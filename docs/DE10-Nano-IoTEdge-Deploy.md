# Deploy Reference Application as Azure IoT Edge module

You DE10-Nano is running Azure IoT Edge Runtime and provisioned to your IoT solution.

Azure IoT Edge provides remote device management including **workloads**.  Workloads are packaged as docker containers and can be deployed to Azure IoT Edge device remotely.  

You can deploy Azure IoT Edge module through various tools such as :

- Azure Portal <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-deploy-modules-portal?view=iotedge-2020-11>
- Azure CLI <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-deploy-modules-cli?view=iotedge-2020-11>
- Visual Studio Code <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-deploy-modules-vscode?view=iotedge-2020-11>

Deployment information, such as which IoT Edge module to deploy and parameters to pass, are done through a JSON file called **deployment manifest**.

More information on Deployment Manifest : <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/module-composition?view=iotedge-2020-11>
